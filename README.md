# Tic Tac Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

This is a **Flask-based Tic Tac Toe game** where a player competes against an AI opponent. The AI utilizes the **Minimax Algorithm** to make optimal moves, ensuring a challenging experience.

## Features 🚀
✅ **Single-player mode** (vs AI)  
✅ **AI uses Minimax Algorithm** for optimal moves  
✅ **Real-time interaction** using JavaScript and Flask APIs  
✅ **Automatic win/draw detection**  
✅ **Game reset option**

## How the AI Works 🤖
- The AI is implemented using the **Minimax Algorithm**, which evaluates all possible moves and chooses the one that minimizes the player's chances of winning.
- The AI **always plays as 'O'**, while the player is **'X'**.
- The AI picks the best move after the player moves, ensuring optimal play.
